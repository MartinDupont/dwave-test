# D-Wave test
This repo was a project to test the capabilities of the D-Wave quantum computer. I summarized the results in a 
powerpoint, which has now unfortunately been lost. TLDR; it sucks. 

For a demonstration of its performance on a nontrivial problem, all you need to look at is `presentation/quantum_times.jpg`. It doesn't even outperform simulated annealing, even 
for very small problems. Furthermore, as the problem gets bigger the chance of it failing to find a solution grows rapidly too,
due to the failure chance of finding a good embedding onto the quantum hardware.

The diagrams for the presentation have been added to the repo as documentation.
